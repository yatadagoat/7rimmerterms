## 1. Use of the App
You must be at least 13 years old to use 7rimmer. The app provides AI-generated suggestions for accounts to unfollow on social media platforms. We do not unfollow on your behalf — all actions are initiated manually by the user.

7rimmer uses AI to suggest accounts to unfollow based on criteria you provide. These are suggestions only — you have full control over any action you take.

7rimmer is provided “as-is”. We are not responsible for any unintended consequences of using the service, including but not limited to account suspensions or user disagreements.

## 5. Changes
